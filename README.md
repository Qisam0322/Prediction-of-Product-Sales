From the graph, Product store sales and Max retail price have a positive correlation of 0.57. However, the correlation is moderate. There is no other noticeable correlation (>0.3 or <-0.3) other than Product store sales and MRP.

The countplot above gives me some insights into the product count of each category separated by LowFat/Regular. In general, the company has more low-fat product (product counts not product types) in stores than regular products but for the 'meat' and 'breakfast' categories the company has more regular products than low-fat products.
